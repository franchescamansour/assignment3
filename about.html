        <p>Our company first started as a home business between two sisters that were so passionate about makeup but were tired of using daily products that contained chemicals. They decided to take a stand and start their own makeup line starting with a few products to try it out. With intense reaserch, course taking and meeting up with business founders and makeup scientist professionals, they were able to accomplish their dream. Slowly selling to friends and family the word spread out, endless nights of hard work and long days of advertisement, people were able to test out and come back for more. The goal was to let people experience chemical free and organic makeup products while retaining the quality of high end brands to leave a glowing look, wich is how the name "Organiglow" was created. Finally, business grew, people were getting hired and all became a family and comunity that are chasing our dream to expand, wich is what happened. Were here to help you and are coming up with more products that you will love.
